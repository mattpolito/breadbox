# Gravtastic

<small>The super fantastic way of getting Gravatars. By [Chris](http://chrislloyd.com.au).</small>

In less than 5 minutes you can add Gravatars to your Ruby project. It works in Rails, Merb _and_ plain ol' Ruby.

The best way to learn more about Gravtastic is to [look at the source](http://github.com/chrislloyd/gravtastic/blob/master/lib/gravtastic.rb). It's one file, about 80 LOC and really pretty simple. If that isn't for you, then follow the instructions below!

## Install

    sudo gem install gravtastic

## Usage

Add this to your `environment.rb`:

    config.gem 'gravtastic', :version => '>= 2.1.0'

Next, say that you want a Gravatar for your model:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      is_gravtastic!
    end

And you are done! In your views you can now use the `#gravatar_url` method:

    <%= image_tag @user.gravatar_url %>

If you want to change the image, you can do this:

    <%= image_tag @user.gravatar_url(:rating => 'R', :secure => true) %>

That will show R rated Gravatars over a secure connection. If you find yourself repeating that all around your app, you can set the Gravatar defaults. In your model, just change the `is_gravtastic!` line to something like this:

    is_gravtastic :author_email, :secure => true,
                                 :filetype => :gif,
                                 :size => 120

Now all your Gravatars will come from a secure connection, be a GIF and be 120x120px. The email will also come from the `author_email` field, not the default `email` field. Don't worry, you arn't locked into these defaults (you can override them by passing options to `#gravatar_url` like before).

_Note: You can use either `is_gravtastic!` or `is_gravtastic`, they both do the same thing._

### Plain Ruby

So you just have a regular ol' Ruby app? No Rails and ActiveRecord?

    require 'gravtastic'
    class BoringUser
      include Gravtastic
      is_gravtastic!
    end

And wallah! That works exactly the same as in Rails! Now all instances of the BoringUser class will have `#gravatar_url` methods.

_Note: the `#gravatar_url` methods don't get included until you specify the class `is_gravtastic!`_
